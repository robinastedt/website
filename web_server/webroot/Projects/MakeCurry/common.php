<p>Utility function for making curry out of multiple argument functions!</p>

<p>When programming in C++, do you often find yourself missing the magic of Haskell's naturally curried syntax? Then this is for you! Avoid declaring functions using the mess that is nested lambda expressions and simply use the normal C++ syntax to declare your functions like a sane person and make_curry will translate it into a curryingable function for you!</p>
