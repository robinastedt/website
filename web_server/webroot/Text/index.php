<p>[2024-03-23]</p>

<p>How do I express the unspeakable?<br />
The silent mist that creeps at night.<br />
How do I bridge the untouchable?<br />
The dangers that lurk at the edge of mind.</p>

<p>There are things of which I do not dare speak,<br />
lest I crumble where I stand.<br />
How do I, my friend, liaise<br />
what within myself lay deep.</p>

<p>The violence of mental anguish<br />
chocks me to my core.<br />
Madness upon madness upon madness<br />
a torrent of dissociation.</p>

<p>The hellscape within lay bare.<br />
For when I dare its peak summit<br />
upon this outlook I behold<br />
the tyranny of the mind.</p>

<h3 id="Arbitrary">Arbitrary</h3>

<p>[2023-11-02]</p>

<p>Arbitrary evil is far worse than malicious evil.</p>
<p>At least the malicious will gain some kind of benefit out of the affair.
The arbitrary is not only hateful, it is tragic too.</p>
<p>The malicious will leave you with hope of retribution, while the arbitrary will leave you confused, asking "why?"</p>

<p>[2023-03-24]</p>

<p>I recall the pain of yesteryear,<br />
A mushroom cloud that lingers near.<br />
In the aftermath, I've come to know,<br />
Decades of winter, ice, and snow.</p>

<p>Though the sun begins to climb,<br />
Permafrost still holds my time.<br />
As seasons change, I seek the spark,<br />
To warm my soul and heal the dark.</p>

<p>Within the shadows, I'll find my way,<br />
Embracing life as dawn breaks day.<br />
In time, I'll sow the seeds of fate,<br />
Nurturing growth, a change innate.</p>

<p>Though my heart may ache and yearn,<br />
Yesteryear's pain will ever burn.<br />
In newfound light, I'll rise and strive,<br />
Forever scarred, but so alive.</p>

<p>The meaning of life is a good cup of coffee<br />
The meaning of life is a cigarette after sex<br />
The meaning of life is love<br />

<p>You're the astrononer,<br />
who denies the stars<br />
Eccentric, yet grounded,<br />
you make this life ours</p>

<p>With you, come what may<br />
Grab life by the throat<br />
Let's do it together<br />
On linen or in the moat</p>

<p>Let's ride into battle<br />
On horseback or sheep<br />
Victorious or slain<br />

<p>Lost morality, empathy gone<br />
Forgotten, hidden behind layers of cynicism<br />
The elitist pig that push<br />
Thoughts, all the views that sting</p>

<p>Living, striving, looking for success<br />
Run them over, those who stand in the way<br />
Criticize, harass, those who can not<br />
See them raise their hands in desperation</p>

<p>Then it happens that must not<br />
Consuming the drug that numbs<br />
The alcohol is spreading its message<br />
Not of pain, not of violence</p>

<p>Verge of tears, I see their lives<br />
The grief overwhelms what I do not want to see<br />
Those who can not, those who do not want<br />
Those who were brought to life without anesthesia</p>

<p>[2014-08-02]</p>

<p>Are there truths in Life?<br />
Or are there just perceptions,<br />
of a world too complex to understand<br />
To guide us down Darwin's path.</p>

<p>My reasons are fading,<br />
yet my life pulse is strong<br />
I feel hypocritical for staying alive,<br />
yet burning with ambition</p>

<p>I know it is fake,<br />
this human condition<br />
Yet spellbound I am<br />
So obvious, it hurts</p>

<p>An enticing grip around my cock,<br />
this cold, unforgiving mistress has.<br />
To keep me around for another 50 years<br />
in desperate attempts, looking for meaning</p>

<p>When you crashed<br />

Fraktal av ett liv<br />

Ett hj&auml;rta f&ouml;rtvivlat<br />

My face tormented<br />
infinite stars<br />
A single gaze</p>

<p>thousands of memories<br />

Fractal of a life<br />
Which draws to a close</p>

<p>Limbs, numb<br />
A heart in despair<br />

My gaze unfocus</p>

Into an eternity<br />
A reality in darkness<br />
One last breath</p>

<p>Seven billion links in the chain<br />
One among them is pretty vain<br />
So who are you? Want to succeed?<br />
You will confess, after you've kneeled</p>

<p>Seven billion walks in the rain<br />
Why should I care about your pain?<br />
It's not worth it, leave it behind<br />
Don't turn against your own shy kind</p>

<p>Seven billion pursuits freedom<br />
But you alone sing their anthem<br />
Slow down, eventually cease<br />
Otherwise, your lifespan will decrease</p>

<p>Seven billion walks in the shade<br />
From nothing special are you made<br />
Halt, shut up, and join this decay<br />
Follow my words, your brain's like clay</p>

<p>Seven billion souls in despair<br />
One single smile is oh so rare<br />
Why do you think you're so grand?<br />
You will fall by the denying hand!</p>

<!--THE ELITE START-->
<h3 id="TheElite">The Elite</h3>

<p>[2010-09-20]</p>

<p>A tiny percent of the population of earth, above all others; an infinitive elite.</p>

<p>As rulers of the world they put the sky on fire. They opened up the gates to hell and threw down the people of the earth, saving themselves standing on their burning skulls.</p>

<p>Using all of the world’s resources themselves they created their own paradise and leaving behind the people in their bi-product, a man made hell.</p>

<p>As Queens and Workers they fought. Blood was spilt. Skulls were shattered. Bones crushed.</p>

<p>Down the fire they were thrown, but from fire they would return. Heart-broken and forged by fire they would one day reach through.</p>

<p>Several riots occurred, but the attacks slowly began to reduce in frequency and eventually they stopped completely.</p>

<p>At first, they were needed, their bodies as cogs in the gear. But after several decades machines took over for better efficiency and they were mostly kept alive by moral codes still carved on the inside of their masters’ cranium.</p>

<p>Because they weren’t needed anymore they were easier to tame. They almost were forgotten in their cells. Controlled breeding and feeding. Everything controlled by machines they kept a constant number.</p>

<p>After several centuries they started to look like the stones in the walls of their prison. A world of grey. Machines and forgotten bodies. Life erased. All this, but with a shining core as of a million suns; holding the never-ending Elite alive with a world dedicated to those born under the morning star.</p>

There will be a holy war</p>

In a war of such enormous scale!</p>

Another will make the gods look small</p>
